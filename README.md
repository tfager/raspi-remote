# raspi-remote

Original idea was a Raspberry Pi web-enabled remote control powered by LIRC, Node-Red and Mosquitto.

In practice this is turning out a collection of ansible roles and bits&pieces to try out with Raspberry Pi.

This repository contains ansible configurations to install the required things into a
Raspberry Pi with freshly flashed Raspbian, and a tiny python web app to display
a user interface.

## Hardware Setup

### Infrared transmitter

Get something like this: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/10732

And connect:
* VCC to 5V (e.g. Pin 4 on Raspberry Pi 3B)
* GND to GND (e.g. Pin 6)
* CTL to GPIO27 (Pin 13) (or whichever you [configure](https://github.com/tfager/raspi-remote/blob/master/ansible/roles/gpio-ir/tasks/main.yml#L13))

### ePaper display

Get this: https://www.waveshare.com/2.7inch-e-paper-hat.htm

In my case, I wanted to connect other things on the RasPi besides the ePaper HAT,
so I used the separate connector with colored wires. In my case it was like this:

HAT|Wire|RasPi
---|:---|---
VCC| Red |17|
GND| Black | 9 |
DIN | Blue | 19 (GPIO10)
CLK | Yellow | 23 (GPIO11)
CS  |Â Orange | 24 (GPIO8)
DC  | Green | 22 (GPIO25)
RST | White | 11 (GPIO17)
BUSY| Purple | 18 (GPIO24)

### DHT22 humidity sensor

This: https://ihmevekotin.fi/product/262_dht22-digitaalinen-l%C3%A4mp%C3%B6tila-ja-ilmankosteusanturi

And connect (numbers counting from left to right, facing the text on DHT22):
* 1 VCC - 5V (RasPi Pin 2)
* 2 CTL - GPIO21 (RasPi Pin 40)
* 3 not connected
* 4 GND - GND (RasPi Pin 39)

### Notes on Samson USB Mic & audio

Finding out pyaudio device index:
```
python3
import pyaudio
pa = pyaudio.PyAudio()
for i in range(pa.get_device_count()):                         
    print (i, pa.get_device_info_by_index(i))
```
Finding out the correct sample rate:

```
arecord --list-devices   # pick the correct one for -D option below
arecord -f dat -r 60000 -D hw:0,0 -d 5 test.wav
```
The error message (e.g. `Warning: rate is not accurate (requested = 60000Hz, got = 48000Hz`) will tell the correct rate.

## Software Setup

* install [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) to the RasPi
* install ansible (`cd ansible; pip3 install -r requirements.txt` will do)
* set up your SSH key to the Raspberry Pi

Make sure your pi is accessible via ssh with name "raspberrypi.local" (or modify `inventory/default.yml`).

### Note on LIRC

This configuration will also set up a secondary LIRC instance because with gpio_ir module it's
not possible to do reception and transmission with same instance. This is based on
[these instructions](http://lirc.org/html/configuration-guide.html#appendix-9).

### Deepspeech speech recognition

Attempting to recognize spoken words with an [USB microphone](https://www.verkkokauppa.com/fi/product/10892/kqkjj/Samson-Go-Mic-Direct-mikrofoni-USB-vaylaan),
inspired by https://www.seeedstudio.com/blog/2020/01/23/offline-speech-recognition-on-raspberry-pi-4-with-respeaker/
there's now [deepspeech](./ansible/roles/deepspeech) role to install [deepspeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech).
After the setup, recorded wav files were indeed recognized with this command line:
```
deepspeech --model deepspeech-0.7.1-models.tflite --scorer deepspeech-0.7.1-models.scorer --audio test.wav
```

But trying to instantly recognize spoken words from microphone [with this example](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech-examples/tree/r0.7/mic_vad_streaming)
didn't yield any results. It was not clear if the program wasn't even receiving data from the
microphone, or just too slow to process it (processing the wav files took longer than their duration).



## Install

In ansible directory:

`ansible-playbook -i inventory/default.yml playbook.yml`
